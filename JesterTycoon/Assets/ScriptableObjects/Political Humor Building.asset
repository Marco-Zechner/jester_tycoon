  description: 'Imagine a satirical government building, dubbed the ''Capitol of
    Comedy'' with an exaggerated sense of grandeur. Its facade features an array
    of comically oversized windows, trying to show power. This structure represents
    not order, but the controlled chaos of satire, where each policy is open to puns
    and every action of a legislator is met with a joke. '
