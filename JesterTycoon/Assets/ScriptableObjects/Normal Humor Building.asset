  description: 'The Pavilion of Playfulness is a charming circus tent where laughter
    is always in the air. Its classic red and white stripes and welcoming open door
    make it the heart of hilarity in a game of joyful jests. Inside, every joke lands
    softly like a tumbling acrobat, and every act is a delightful dance of wit and
    whimsy. '
